## Description

This program uses OpenGL, GLSL, and C++ code to create a scene that displays light attenuation. Light attenuation refers to the falling off of the intensity of a light as the distance from the light source increases. In this scene, there are 100 objects of type bunny, teapot, sphere, and vase. The bunnies are rotating about their y-axis with time. The teapots are shearing back and forth with time. The spheres are bouncing up and down as well as squashing and stretching after hitting the surface. To create the motion of the vases, I used a surface of revolution. Both the bunnies and teapots are read in as .obj files and drawn using array-based drawing. The spheres and teapots, however, use index-based drawing.
